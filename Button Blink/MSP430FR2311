/*
/* DETAILED EXPLANATION OF EACH LINE:
First line is meant to disable the watchdog timer, watchdog timer is a peripheral which helps
to prevent program from getting stuck in a place where it shouldn’t be;
for example, if the program got stuck in an infinite loop, which is very possible in c,
 the watchdog timer monitors that a specific amount of time has passed;
  thus it resets the device, so that the device can function properly again,
 but since the scope of these programs is so simple
 one does not have to be concern of getting stuck in an infinite loop;
 therefore, the watchdog timer is disabled.


Next, to ensure that the bits stored in the P1OUT register are cleared the previous values
are bitwised AND with the opposite of the desired cleared bit, the zeroth bit. e.g: 
                                                                               0000 0000                 0000 0001   
                                                                             & 0000 0001                 0000 0000
                                                                               0000 0000                 0000 0000 
                                                                               
                                                            (both cases bit zero is cleared and state is defined as off)
   
   
   
   
Next line is meant to configure the general-purpose input/out pin, this is accomplished by enabling the direction register of the port pin as an input or output.
For example, the port pin P1’s direction register is enabled as an output by it setting equal to P1DIR
(eight-bit direction register) bitwise OR with 1, which can be seen in this line as P1DIR |= 0x01, or rather in this example simple bit0.
<PIN7><PIN6><PIN5><PIN4><PIN3><PIN2><PIN1><PIN0>



                                                                            

Next line "Disables the GPIO power-on default high-impedance mode to activate previously configured port settings (TI)", 
this is due to the fact that LOCKLPM5 is set to enable a lock that is within the memory mapped output register

To enable control from the user the P1DIR register is then enabled as an input such that pin 1, the button is specified as bit 1. 


Next, the internal pull up/pull down resistor is enabled, described and illustrated in the datasheet for the msp430fr2311 
P1REN is of four inputs to an AND gate
another one of these four inputs is P1DIR, so if P1REN is not set high then the enabling of P1DIR as an output has no effect since it
will output a zero due to the lowstate of P1REN and overall schematic design.

Next, a control state is reached, a while loop, which loops indefinitely, and acts similar to for(;;).
The contents within, which execute the functionality of the swithc are implemented using conditional statements. First, an if statement 
checks if the button, Pin 1 is not pressed, or bit 1 is not high by performing bitwise AND operation with P1IN (register) and BIT1 , if this
condition is met then the LED is turned off; otherwise the LED is left on by enabling it ON with bitwise OR operation. The loop then repeats
and the switch functionality is accomplished
