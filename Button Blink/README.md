# Button Blink
This repository includes the necessary files to execute a switch on both the MSP430FR2311 and MSP430G2553. The switch rests in the normally closed position such that when the button is pressed the LED is turned off and is on prior to being pressed. 

### Color Change
What if upon a button press, the LED which was blinking changed. Some of the development boards contain two LEDs, so you could swap between a Red and a Green LED.
