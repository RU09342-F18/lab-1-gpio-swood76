# Button Blink
This repository includes the necessary files to execute a switch on both the MSP430FR2311 and MSP430G2553. The switch rests in the normally closed position such that when the button is pressed the LED is turned off and is on prior to being pressed. Includes code which implemented both the simple button blink on the MSP430FR2311 and blink color change on button press on the MSP430G25
