# Multiple Blink
This repository includes the necessary files to blink two LEDS on both the MSP430F5529 and the MSP30G2553 at two distinct rates. The MSP430F5529, the rate of toggle for the F5529 was set to 3000 and the G2553 was set to 30,000. This resulted in the red LED to blink, or toggle significantly faster than that of the green LED.
