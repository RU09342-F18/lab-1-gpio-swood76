# Multiple Blink
This repository includes the necessary files to blink two LEDS on both the MSP430F5529 and the MSP30G2553 at two distinct rates. The MSP430F5529 was set for a difference in counter magnitude of 10,000. This resulted in the red LED to blink, or toggle significantly faster than that of the green LED.
