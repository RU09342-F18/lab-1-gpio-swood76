# Simple Blink
This repository includes the necessary files to execute a simple blink of an LED for both the MSP430G2553 and MSP432P401R. The blink rate effect for each was distinct. For example, the rate of delay for the MSP432 family launchpad was decided to be programmed to be 20,000 and the MSP430G2553 was set to 50,000. The LED blink on both was limited to port 1 of the GPIO pins; as a result, the same PxDIRy, PxOUTy were utlilized. Essentially identical logic was performed to successfully toggle the LEDs on both, the only difference is the delays, and how they were implemented for each microcontroller.
